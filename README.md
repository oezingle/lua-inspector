# WARNING: abandoned branch

Initially I had plans to add mouse handling to the cli. However, I've decided the complexity is not worth it. Only supported terminals under POSIX unixes would work, and keyboard functionality would disappear. As such, this branch is likely to be left as is, behind on any bugfixes and changes. I will post the mouse handling code as a Gist, in case it comes in handy for anyone.
